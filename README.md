# FAST-Nuces-Timetable-Manipulation-Pandas
The FAST NUces Timetable Manipulation project allows you to read and manipulate timetables using the power of Pandas. By implementing the provided tasks, you will be able to extract valuable information from the timetable data, such as specific subject classes, empty slots, and busy classrooms or labs.

# Platform
Jupyter Notebook is just one of the available platforms for executing Python code. If you prefer a different platform, you can adapt the project accordingly.

# Getting Started
To get started with the FAST NUces Timetable Manipulation project, follow these steps:

Make sure you have Python installed on your system.
Gather the timetable data in a format that can be read using Pandas (e.g., CSV, Excel, or a compatible data format).
Implement the functions/tasks described in the project description using Pandas for data manipulation.
Test each functionality/task to ensure its correctness and proper functioning.
Document your code, including comments and meaningful variable names, to ensure readability and maintainability.
